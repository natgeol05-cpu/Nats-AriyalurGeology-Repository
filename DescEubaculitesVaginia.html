            Name: Eubaculites vaginia<br>
            Formation: Ariyalur Group  <br>
            Locality: Ottakkovil in TANCEM mines <br>       
            Classification: Molluscs: Cephalopoda:Ammonoidea: Ammonitida: SubOrder - Ancyloceratina, Family - Baculitidae 
            <p>
            <article>
                Eubaculites is an extinct genus of cephalopods in the family Baculitidae and each known species was initially<br> 
                placed within the related genus Baculites until it was placed in a separate genus in 1926. <br>
                Eubaculites existed from the Turonian until the Danian, and is one of the very last genera of ammonites, <br>
                going extinct roughly 64.5 million years ago, which was around 500,000 years after the start of the Cenozoic.<br>
                Specimens found in the Maastricht Formation in The Netherlands suggest that at least one species <br>
                (E. carinatus) survived the K-Pg mass extinction event, albeit being restricted to the Danian.    <p>              

                A Baculite segment is a fossilized piece of the shell from a Baculites, an extinct genus of cephalopod <br>
                that lived during the Late Cretaceous period. <br>
                These fossils are known for their nearly straight, horn-like shells, and segments are often collected from <br>
                locations like the Pierre Shale in South Dakota or the Bearpaw Formation in Montana.<br>
                Some fossilized segments show iridescent colors due to opal replacement (ammolite) and may be found with other fossils. <br>
                <p> 
                •	What it is: A piece of a Baculites fossil, which was a type of ammonite that had a straight shell, <br>
                    unlike the more common coiled ammonites.<br>
                •	Time period: The Baculites genus lived throughout most of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 75 to 80 million years ago.<br>
                •	Fossilization: The fossils are often found preserved in shale or a concretion matrix.  <br>
                •	Appearance: Some segments can have a beautiful opalescent quality, known as ammolite, <br>
                    with iridescent colors like pinks and greens when light hits them.<br>
                •	Where they are found: They are common fossils in places like the Pierre Shale formation in South Dakota <br>
                    and the Bearpaw Formation in Montana. <br>
                •	Identification: The intricate internal structures called sutures are often used to identify the different <br>
                    species within the Baculites genus.

                Baculites showing sutures.<br>
                Baculites fossils are very brittle and almost always break.<br>
                They are most commonly found broken in half or several pieces, usually along suture lines.<br>
                Individual chambers found this way are sometimes referred to as "stone buffaloes" (due to their shapes).
